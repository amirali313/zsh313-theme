# zsh313-theme

Ever tired of your cli ?

Too complicated interface ?

If yes, then you are in the right place :)

This is a minimal and simple theme for ZSH !

You always have time next to you

No more redundant info on your screen

Plus, never get tired of typing command to see your return code, because it is fixed next to the clock.
